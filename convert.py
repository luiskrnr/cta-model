    @brief Convert a NIfTI (.nii) image to MetaImage (.mha) format with overwrite protection.

    Reads the specified .nii file using SimpleITK, constructs an output filename in the given
    directory and writes the image as a .mha file. If the target .mha already exists, the user
    is prompted to confirm before overwriting.

    @param input_nii_path
        Full path to source (.nii) file. If reading this file fails, the function
        terminates with an error.
    @param output_mha_path
        Directory where the converted MetaImage (.mha) file will be written. The output filename
        is derived from the base name of `input_nii_path`. If this directory is not writable
        or the user declines to overwrite, the function exits without writing.

    @return
        Prints the full path of the newly created .mha file to stdout for downstream processing.

    @exception RuntimeError
        Raised if the input file cannot be read, if writing to the output path fails, or if
        the user declines to overwrite an existing file.

    @note
        Converting from NIfTI to MetaImage may drop certain NIfTI-specific metadata.
